# KuaiSAR: An Unified Search and Recommendation Dataset

[![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-CC%20BY--SA%204.0-green)](https://github.com/chongminggao/KuaiRand/blob/main/LICENSE)

*KuaiSAR* is unified search and recommendation dataset collected from the genuine user behavior logs of the short-video mobile app, [Kuaishou (快手)](https://www.kuaishou.com/en).  
**It is the first dataset which records genuine user behaviors, the occurrence of each interaction within either search or recommendation service, and the users' transitions between the two services!** 
<!-- *KuaiRand* is an unbiased sequential recommendation dataset collected from the recommendation logs of the video-sharing mobile app, [Kuaishou (快手)](https://www.kuaishou.com/cn).  **It is the first recommendation dataset with millions of  intervened interactions of randomly exposed items inserted in the standard recommendation feeds!**  -->

<!-- Another related **open-sourced** dataset is **[KuaiRec](https://kuairec.com/)**. -->


## Overview:

The following figure gives an example of the dataset. It illustrates a user interaction sequence along with the user's rich feedback signals.

These feedback signals are collected from the two main user interfaces (UI) in Kuaishou APP shown as follows:

<!-- In the random exposure stage, each recommended video in the dataset has an equal probability being replaced by a random video sampled from an item pools. About $0.37\%$ Interactions are replaced in the final results.  -->

#### Advantages:

Compared with other existing datasets, KuaiSAR has the following advantages:

- ✅ It is the first dataset with user genuine search and recommendation behaviros.
- ✅ It has all user-system interactions in search and recommendation scenarios, including interactions of both postive and negative feedback.
- ✅ It has diverse side information including explicit user IDs, interaction timestamps, and rich features for users and items.
- ✅ Each user has thousands of historical interactions on average.
