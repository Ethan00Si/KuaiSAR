# KuaiSAR

*KuaiSAR* is a unified search and recommendation dataset containing the genuine user behavior logs collected from the short-video mobile app, [Kuaishou (快手)](https://www.kuaishou.com/en), a leading short-video app in China with over 300 million daily active users.  
**It is the first dataset which records genuine user behaviors, the occurrence of each interaction within either search or recommendation service, and the users' transitions between the two services!** 


## Overview:

As shown in the following figure, Kuaishou provides both search and recommendation services.
The figure illustrates integrated search and recommendation scenarios in Kuaishou app. 
When watching a video, the user can either scroll up and down to browse different videos with the recommendation service (from middle to left); or
tap on the magnifying glass to access the search service (from middle to right).
